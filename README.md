# A user panel built with Express+React

And with these honorable mentions:

* `passport` - authentication (probably was an overkill to use it)
* `sequelize` - database ORM
* `bcrypt` - hash passwords
* `moment` - date to string in the `last seen 3 minutes ago` format
* `chance` - fake data on the client to ease development & testing out the app
* `mantine` - UI components for React 
* `tabler` - icons

## Functionality

* Authentication: Register, login, logout
* Form validation
* Extra: random form filler to ease dummy registration
* Table displaying all users
* Advanced selection for table entries
* Select users to delete/block/unblock them. 
* Only authorized (not blocked) users may perform the aforementioned CRUD
